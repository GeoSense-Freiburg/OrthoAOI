# OrthoAOI
This project uses self-supervised DINO models trained on existing Areas of Interest (AOIs) to learn spatial and semantic patterns in orthomosaics and automatically predict meaningful AOIs in new, unseen orthos. The goal is to scale AOI discovery across large UAV datasets with minimal manual annotation.
